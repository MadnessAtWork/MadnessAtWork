# Cookie Database

## Overview
This database and GUI project was created in 2025 for my senior project. The entire project was created, presented, and reflected upon within a 5 week timespan. The initial project idea was proposed by my spouse to collect the order infromation of her online cookie business, store it in a database, and present some simple statistics in a graphically pleasing manner. If you examine the database, you might notice some invalid entries. They were the result of testing the custom function that checks if all characters in a string are numerical digits for the sake of screening phone numbers, and the flaws have been fixed and they were left in the database for the sake of providing evidence of thorough testing.

## Features
- **Local Database**: Due to the small scale of the company that would use this application, a local database on a secure device would easily support my wife's needs.
- **Simplistic User Interface**: All menus are intuitive and simplistic, reducing the strain of interacting with the database as a whole. Perfect for a nontechnical company.
- **Statistical Display**: Utilizes two piecharts to display the percentage frequency of orders containing specific types of cookies and mixins.
- **APIs**: Utilizes the well documented SQL server and Windows Forms libraries for ease of understanding from any future developers.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my wife, Megan Carpenter, for supplying me with the idea for a relatively small scale project that could be accomplished in such a short time frame along with informing me as to the data that would need to be contained in the database, greatly reducing the amount of research I needed to perform in such a limited time frame.
