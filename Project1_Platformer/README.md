# Mouse Game

## Overview
This platformer game was developed from scratch using C# and MonoGame for the Business Professionals of America (BPA) game development contest. The project was a collaborative effort between Daniel Carpenter and Matthew Gonzalez. Was made to demonstrate modularity, save state storage, and an engaging experience. This competition occurred in the school year of 2019-2020. It was originally called Mouse Game as we originally planned to use Mouse sprites, but as we became consumed in developing the game in proper, we left character design on the wayside and opted for adaptable cube sprites.

## Features
- **Custom Engine**: Built entirely from scratch using C# and MonoGame.
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Includes multiple levels, unique enemies, and challenging obstacles.
- **Graphics and Sound**: Simplistic but adaptable sprites, fundamental animations that can be improved at a later date, and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation.
